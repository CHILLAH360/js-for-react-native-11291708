Explanation:
Function Declaration: The processArray function is defined to take a single parameter arr, which is expected to be an array of numbers.
Array Mapping: The map method is used to create a new array based on the transformations defined in the callback function:
For each number num in the array:
If num is even (num % 2 === 0), it is squared (num * num).
If num is odd, it is tripled (num * 3).
Return Value: The resulting array after applying the transformations is returned.
Example Usage:
The commented-out example usage demonstrates how to call the processArray function with an input array [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and shows the resulting transformed array [3, 4, 9, 16, 15].
processArray Function: This function remains the same as previously defined. It processes an array of numbers by squaring even numbers and tripling odd numbers.
formatArrayStrings Function:
Parameters: It takes two arrays as parameters:
strArr: An array of strings.
numArr: An array of numbers that have been processed by processArray.
Mapping Strings: It uses the map method to iterate over strArr and modifies each string based on the corresponding number in numArr:
If the corresponding number is even (numArr[index] % 2 === 0), the string is converted to uppercase (str.toUpperCase()).
If the corresponding number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase (str.toLowerCase()).
Example Usage:
The inputArray is processed using processArray, resulting in processedNumbers array.
The stringArray is formatted using formatArrayStrings based on the processedNumbers, resulting in formattedStrings.
Function Declaration: The createUserProfiles function is defined to take two parameters:
originalNames: An array of original names.
modifiedNames: An array of modified names that correspond to the original names.
Mapping to Objects:
The map method is used to iterate over the originalNames array.
For each name in the array, an object is created with the following properties:
originalName: The original name from the originalNames array.
modifiedName: The corresponding modified name from the modifiedNames array.
id: An auto-incremented ID starting from 1 (index + 1).
Return Value: The resulting array of objects is returned.
Example Usage:
The commented-out example usage demonstrates how to call the createUserProfiles function with arrays of original and modified names, and it logs the resulting array of user profile objects to the console.
